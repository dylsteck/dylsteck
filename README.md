My personal website, live at [dylansteck.com](https://dylansteck.com)

Structure: 
- All articles are stored in .mdx files(`src/pages/articles`), with an index kept at `src/lib/articles.ts`
- All images are stored on/fetched from [Cloudinary](https://cloudinary.com)

In the short-term, I'm going to keep making updates to the site as needed -- but in the longer-term I'm interested in how I can further unify the components and data that make up my digital life(eg. does the data on this site/data in [Cortex](https://withcortex) become my own personal life SDK?)
