summary: 'An update on how app stores are forming inside of other apps, both in crypto and AI'
---

New tech paradigms require ways for end users to access them in order for their consumer usage to truly blow up, and both crypto and AI are getting this with their own embedded app stores. 

**In crypto:** Base, Farcaster, World, and Telegram have mini app platforms with direct wallet connections and [as wallets have been going social](/blog/when-wallets-meet-social) these mini apps help give users one place to find and do things in crypto.

**In AI:** Anthropic, Google, and _especially_ OpenAI have been trying to create the "app store" for how LLMs interact with your tools and personal data. From ChatGPT Plugins to MCP servers/UI to the most recent ChatGPT Apps SDK and even Express Checkout, these companies are trying to figure out what this connection looks like both for servers and user interfaces.

My day job is working on a mini app platform at [Base](https://base.org) with [Base app](https://base.app) and our suite of developer tools, and funny enough before this I was working on products for Farcaster Frames v1, so for the past few years now I've been focued on embedded apps. In this post I want to go over what I've been seeing in these two ecosystems I've been watching closely, what I think they can actually learn from each other, and question if embedded apps are even the right model.
