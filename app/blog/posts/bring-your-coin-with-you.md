A new wave of creator coins, appcoins, and memecoins are rising and with them come a new flywheel: **bring your coin with you.**

Here's some good context that will help paint this picture. [Jesse](https://base.app/profile/jesse) just [launched his creator coin](https://base.app/post/0x92c072057c70957d9456b3a7a81671bbc2777f45), a [Zora](https://zora.co) coin that represents his profile both on [Base app](https://base.app) and Zora. Each post of his is a content coin paired to his creator coin $jesse, and because post coins trade against the creator coin, every post coin trade routes fees and value back to the creator coin--creating a flywheel where successful posts boost the creator's profile coin ([image source](https://x.com/js_horne/status/1936103144968085844)).

The content coin thesis on its own is exciting in how it tries to help creators monetize and create larger fandom/markets, but where I think it gets even more exciting is around this idea of bringing your coin with you.

To me what this means is finding a set of apps where users can participate in an activity that somehow involves your coin: whether that's a router that has the lowest fees for swapping your coin, a game where you can pay with/use your coin somehow, a livestream where you can tip in the chat using a creator coin, and much more. 

This is what Jesse's asking about in the post below and what I think will only continue to grow. It has implications for creators like Jesse and others, apps like [Bracky](https://bracket.game) or [Cody](https://codygame.com) or [Tortoise](https://tortoise.studio) and countless others that are making appcoins vital parts of their apps and even collabing with others, and even memecoins where people want to continue gathering around a larger community/trend.

Two things that stick out to me about building apps with this model:

- This paves a new way for creatives to collaborate with financial upside, you can figure out some model where an app/creator coin is used and both collaborators(eg. a creator and an app) benefit. This can even happen permissionlessly!
- Users become more invested in ecosystems where their coins work across multiple apps, creating natural retention loops and deeper engagement that benefit both users and app developers. This is also a great way for exsting coins to revitalize their communities.
