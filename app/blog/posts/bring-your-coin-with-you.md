A new wave of creator coins, appcoins, and memecoins are rising and with them come a new flywheel: **bring your coin with you.**

Here's some good context that will help paint this picture. [Jesse](https://base.app/profile/jesse) just [launched his creator coin](https://base.app/post/0x92c072057c70957d9456b3a7a81671bbc2777f45), a [Zora](https://zora.co) coin that represents his profile both on [Base app](https://base.app) and Zora. Each post of his is a content coin paired to his creator coin $jesse, and because post coins trade against the creator coin, every post coin trade routes fees and value back to the creator coin--creating a flywheel where successful posts boost the creator's profile coin ([image source](https://x.com/js_horne/status/1936103144968085844)).

The creator coin thesis on its own is exciting in how it tries to help creators monetize and create larger fandom/markets, but where I think it gets even more exciting is around this idea of bringing your coin with you.

To me what this means is finding a set of apps where users can participate in an activity that somehow involves your coin: whether that's a router that has the lowest fees for swapping your coin, a game where you can pay with/use your coin somehow, a livestream where you can tip in the chat using a creator coin, and much more. 

This is what Jesse's asking about in the post below and what I think will only continue to grow. It has implications for creators like Jesse and others, apps like [Bracky](https://bracket.game) or [Cody](https://codygame.com) or [Tortoise](https://tortoise.studio) and countless others that are making appcoins vital parts of their apps and even collabing with others, and even memecoins where people want to continue gathering around a larger community/trend.

Two things that stick out to me about building apps with this model:

- This paves a new way for creatives to collaborate with financial upside, you can figure out some model where an app/creator coin is used and both collaborators(eg. a creator and an app) benefit. This can even happen permissionlessly!
- Users become more invested in ecosystems where their coins work across multiple apps, creating natural retention loops and deeper engagement that benefit both users and app developers. This is also a great way for exsting coins to revitalize their communities.

It's been fun to watch this play out in real time. We're seeing creators launch coins, apps launch their own and integrate creator coins, and users start to use these coins across platforms. The 'bring your coin with you' model isn't fully formed yet, but the direction feels right and the early examples are already showing why it matters.

**Edit:** I know this isn't about creator coins but about a NFT collection, but there's a related example that's great and I wanted to highlight. [Sayangel](https://farcaster.xyz/sayangel) launched the [Warplets NFT project/miniapp/universe](https://www.warplets.ai) recently, which stemmed from a viral meme about Farcaster's embedded wallet and led to this massively viral project and even Farcaster Pro growth. Not only was there a combo about this mini app that led to it going super viral basically overnight, but it also opened this larger "Warplets universe"(for lack of a better term) where the Warplet is a character that all of these downstream apps are building on top of. While again this isn't necessarily a creator coin, I think it certainly falls in this bucket of a community coming around assets and content -- and doing so in a way that's composable across apps(eg. Warplet as this character that travels with you). Below is an overview of Warplets and this viral loop from [Linda](https://farcaster.xyz/linda)'s recent talk about Farcaster at Devconnect.
