Groups in web3 -- whether that's an open source repository, a channel on Farcaster, or a DAO -- have a _coordination problem_. For most groups, this coordination problem is shown in two ways:

**Lack of mission:** 
Lots of groups(especially DAOs) get misguided because there was never a mission in the first place. As a DAO and its resources grow, it can become easier for plans to deviate and alterior motives to creep up. Some of the best DAOs have very clear missions, and some have even been single purpose DAOs(eg. ConstitutionDAO).

**Lack of data transparency:** 
The ongoings and info surrounding the group are so scattered that it's even harder for members to participate -- and just because web3 makes data available on public ledgers doesn't always mean it's accessible/legible! Because it can be so difficult to find out even simple details/take simple actions about a DAO, many members dormantly sit around.

I think the solution to this problem is creating an onchain nucleus: a homepage for each group that clearly showcases its ongoings, as well as offers tooling out-the-box. While it doesn't change the need for people to coordinate around a *goal*, it makes the act of bringing your group together much easier, which is hopefully an incentive. In this article, I'm going to outline where in the Ethereum ecosystem this problem is apparent and how an onchain nucleus(nuclei?) could take form, and where it already has to certain extents.
